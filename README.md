# burger

This burger log was created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. You input the burger you want to eat, then click "devour" when you are ready to eat it! Pretty simple demonstration of the use of a MySQL database.

To access the app, you will need to NPM install, update your own username and password in the connection.js file, and run `node server.js` in the command line. 

Or to see how it works - it is deployed through Heroku: https://powerful-refuge-73813.herokuapp.com/
